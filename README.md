  Navigate to the project directory.
  Run the bank.ipynb file using a Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook.
**Usage**
  Upon running the bank.ipynb file, you will be prompted to enter an account number and PIN.
  If the account number and PIN are valid, you will be presented with a menu of options.
  Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various banking operations.
**Code Structure**
  The project consists of a single Python class called bank that encapsulates all the functionality. The class has the following methods:

  no_cust_inc: Increments the number of customers.
  concat_cust_details: Adds customer details to a dictionary.
  change_ROI: Changes the rate of interest.

  pin_change: Changes the account PIN.
  cust_update: Updates customer information.
  account_details: Displays account details.
  transfer: Transfers funds between accounts.

  --------The main function prompts the user for account number and PIN, and if valid, calls the home method to display the main menu.---------------
